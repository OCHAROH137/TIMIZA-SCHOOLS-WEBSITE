               Timiza School has grown remarkably since its establishment and proudly celebrated its 5th anniversary this year. What began as a small institution has now become a vibrant educational community with steadily increasing learner admissions each term — a clear reflection of our commitment to quality education and holistic development.
              </p>
              <p>
               Over the years, we have continued to improve and expand our facilities to meet the evolving needs of our learners. Our modern classrooms, reliable transport system with school buses, and a well-structured Junior Secondary School section are part of our ongoing effort to create an enriched learning environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond academics, Timiza School continues to shine in co-curricular activities. Our learners have excelled in music, drama, and football, earning recognition at various levels and building confidence, teamwork, and talent along the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we stand proud of the strong foundation we have built — a school that nurtures discipline, creativity, and academic excellence, preparing our learners to thrive in every stage of life.
